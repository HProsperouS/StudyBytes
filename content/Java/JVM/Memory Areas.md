## Abstract
---
- Java memory management is a crucial aspect of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The JVM divides its memory into different areas, each serving a specific purpose. 

### 1. Stack
- **Purpose**: Each thread has its own stack which is used to store local variables, method parameters, return addresses, and intermediate computations. Each method call creates a new stack frame which holds these data.

- **Characteristics**: The stack memory is limited, and if a thread requires more stack memory than is available, a `StackOverflowError` is thrown. Stack memory does not require garbage collection.

### 2. Heap
- **Purpose**: The heap is used for dynamic memory allocation for Java objects and arrays. All objects created using the new keyword are stored in the heap.
- **Characteristics**: The heap is shared among all threads and is divided into generations (Young Generation and Old Generation). The size of the heap can be configured using the 
JVM options -Xms (initial heap size) and -Xmx (maximum heap size).
- **Garbage Collection**: Garbage collectors work primarily in the heap to reclaim memory used by objects that are no longer in use.

### 3. Method Area
- **Purpose**: The method area stores class-level data such as class structure, constants, static variables, and the code for methods and constructors. This area is also known as the Permanent Generation (PermGen) before Java 8, and it was replaced by Metaspace in Java 8.
- **Characteristics**: The method area's size can be controlled using the JVM option `-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize`.
