## Abstract
---
- In Java, logical OR (`|`) and short-circuit OR (`||`) operators also exist, and they function similarly to their [[AND]] counterparts but for the OR operation.

1. Logical OR (`|`):
   - Performs a bitwise OR operation on two boolean operands. Both operands are evaluated, even if the first operand is `true`.
   - Example: `a | b`
2. Short-circuit OR (`&&`):
   - If the first operand is true, the second operand is not evaluated because the overall expression is already true.
   - Example: `a || b`
