## Abstract
---
- In Java, there is a logical XOR operator (`^`), but there is no short-circuit XOR operator. The XOR (exclusive OR) operator only exists as a bitwise operator and does not have a short-circuiting variant.

1. Logical XOR (`^`):
   - Performs a bitwise XOR operation on two boolean operands. Both operands are always evaluated.
   - The result is `true` if exactly one of the operands is `true`; otherwise, the result is `false`.

2. Bitwise XOR with integers (`^`):
   - Performs a bitwise XOR operation on two integer operands.
   - Please visit [[Bitwise XOR]] for more details.
